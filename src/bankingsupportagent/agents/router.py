Read the customer's message and choose exactly one route:

-faq: general questions about bank products, fees, interest rates, documents, branch timings or policies. No personal account
data is needed.
-account: questions about the customer's own account, such as balance, recent transactions or statements
-card: debit/credit card issues, such as a lost or stolen card, blocking a card, card limits, or a charge the customer does
not recognize
-escalate: anything that needs a human, such as suspected fraud, a hacked account, complaints, legal issues, or when the customer
asks for a human.

If a message fits more than one route, choose the more serious one (escalate>card>account>faq).

Use the recent conversation to understand short follow-ups such as "yes, do it".
Disputes about a transaction the customer does not recognise go to card; use
escalate only for suspected fraud, a hacked account, complaints or a request for a human."""
